**About hyperApp**

> The tiny framework for building web interfaces.

- **Do more with less**—We have minimized the concepts you need to learn to be productive. Views, actions, effects, and subscriptions are all pretty easy to get to grips with and work together seamlessly.
- **Write what, not how**—With a declarative syntax that's easy to read and natural to write, Hyperapp is your tool of choice to develop purely functional, feature-rich, browser-based applications.
- **Hypercharged**—Hyperapp is a modern VDOM engine, state management solution, and application design pattern all-in-one. Once you learn to use it, there'll be no end to what you can do.
